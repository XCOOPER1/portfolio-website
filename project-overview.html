            <h1>DevOps Docker Web Server Project</h1>
            <p>
                This project demonstrates my expertise in setting up, managing, and automating a web server infrastructure using Docker. <br>
                I have built a production-ready environment that leverages modern technologies such as containerization, CI/CD pipelines, and service orchestration. <br>
                Here's an overview of what this project entails:
            </p>

            <p>
                Key Features:<br>
                - A fully containerized web server using <strong>Docker</strong>.<br>
                - A WordPress site hosted within a Docker container for content management.<br>
                - phpMyAdmin for easy database management using <strong>MySQL</strong>.<br>
                - Reverse proxying with <strong>Nginx</strong> for improved security and traffic handling.<br>
                - Automated deployments with <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> to streamline development and operations.

            <h1>Facial Recognition App on AWS</h1>
            <p>
                This project is a Facial Recognition App built from scratch using AWS services,<br>
                including Amazon Rekognition, Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, and S3.<br>
                The app automates the process of identifying employees based on their facial features<br>
                and integrates various AWS services to perform face detection and recognition.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Key Features:<br>
                Amazon S3: Stores visitor images.<br>
                Amazon Rekognition: Identifies faces and matches them with employee data stored in DynamoDB.<br>
                AWS Lambda: Orchestrates the image retrieval, face recognition, and employee data lookup.<br>
                Amazon DynamoDB: Stores employee details and matches employee face data (using rekognitionId as the key).<br>
                Amazon API Gateway: Provides a RESTful interface that allows external clients to upload images and trigger the recognition process.
